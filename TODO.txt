Refactor "Fire at angle"

Sparks are inefficient

Can I get this game to build without the FLA? I don't want to commit the
FLA, but a build script would be cool - maybe Flex is the answer?

Get rid of "doFrame" - rename it in all cases

Score system

Refactor out all duplicateMovieClip to attachMovie? Will mean a few less symbols on the stage

Make sure the energy bar works

Reimplement loading bar

combo meter needs re-implementing

re-implement game overwd

mobile hud flying ship in

multiplierText

scoreText

scoreFloaterText
